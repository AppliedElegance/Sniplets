# Sniplets

- Want to speed up your work with saved text templates?
- Want to throw some info over from one of your computers to another?
- Moving from Firefox to Edge and miss your Clippings extension?

This extension allows you to quickly 'snip' text from pages you visit (or you can create them manually) and saves them in your browser, allowing you to quickly insert them into forms and editors. Fully backup compatible with the Clippings extension for Firefox.

## Main Features

- Snip/clip text from a webpage using the context menu or Alt+Shift+C where available.
- Insert saved text automatically using the context menu
- Use standard and custom placeholders for each time a sniplet is pasted or sent to the clipboard
- Easily organize sniplets with folder management, drag & drop and colour highlighting
- Backup and restore from Clippings
- Work locally, synchronize across logged in browsers or do both depending on your needs

> [!TIP]
> Translations can now be requested and worked on by the community on [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/9628) or [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/sniplets).

## Latest Version Highlights

> The 0.10 release series is a major overhaul from previous releases as the extension approaches feature parity with Clippings. The name has also been changed from Snippets to Sniplets for ease of finding in the store and to avoid confusing it with [the Chrome DevTools Snippets feature](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/snippets/).

- Compression toggle in case of issues on a specific platform
- Alt+Shift+C keyboard shortcut for clipping selections
- All text moved to translation file
- Enhanced options and behaviour when syncing between browsers

## Features Under Consideration

- rtl toggle
- rich text editing for inline rtl text
- external file sync option with potential for interfacing with Clippings
