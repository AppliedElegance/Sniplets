Ever wanted to save some text for later use, or throw some info over from one of your computers to another? This extension 'snips' text from pages you visit (or you can create them manually) and saves them in your browser, allowing you to quickly insert them into forms and editors using the context menu. Sync them or keep them local, it's up to you. Fully backup compatible with the Clippings extension for Firefox.

## Main Features

- Snip/clip text from a webpage using the context menu or Alt+Shift+C where available.
- Insert saved text automatically using the context menu
- Use placeholders for standard or custom text each time a sniplet is pasted or sent to the clipboard
- Easily organize sniplets with folder management, drag & drop and colour highlighting
- Backup and restore from Clippings

> [!TIP]
> Translations can now be requested and worked on by the community on [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/9393.

## Latest Version Highlights

> The 0.10 release series is a major overhaul from previous releases as the extension approaches feature parity with Clippings. The name has also been changed from Snippets to Sniplets for ease of finding in the store

- Compression toggle in case of issues on a specific platform
- Alt+Shift+C keyboard shortcut for clipping selections
- All text moved to translation file
- Enhanced options and behaviour when syncing between browsers
