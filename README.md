# Sniplets

- Want to speed up your work with saved text templates?
- Want to throw some info over from one of your computers to another?
- Moving from Firefox to {Chrome|Edge} and miss your Clippings extension?

This extension 'snips' text from pages you visit (or you can create them manually) and saves them in your browser, allowing you to quickly insert them into forms and editors. Fully backup compatible with the Clippings extension for Firefox.

## Main Features

- Snip/clip text from a webpage using the context menu or Alt+Shift+C
- Insert saved text automatically using the context menu or the insert button
- Back up and restore from Clippings

## Additional Features

- Easily organize your sniplets with folder management, drag & drop and colour highlighting
- Use placeholders and counters to dynamically update sniplets each time they're pasted or sent to the clipboard
- Work locally, synchronize across logged in browsers or do both depending on your needs
- Quickly access sniplets through the side panel option
- Automatic dark mode to help with eye strain (follows OS setting)

> [!TIP]
> Translations can now be requested and worked on by the community on [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/9628) or [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/sniplets).

## Latest Version Highlights

> The 0.11 release series is again a major overhaul from previous releases as the extension approaches feature parity with Clippings. Code has been modularized and much work has been done under the hood to enhance usability (such as full embedded frame support, sped up actions, and support for more WYSIWYG editors)

- Side panel features and related options
- Dark mode (OS dependant)
- Support for embedded sniplets compatible with Clippings v7 (`$[CLIPPING(name)]`)

## Roadmap

1.0 -> Full feature parity with Clippings for Firefox; features remaining:

- paste via keyboard shortcuts
- editor buttons to add placeholders and counters into a new sniplet
- import (not just restore) from backup

1.1 -> Support for multiple "spaces" to better organize sniplets when doing different types of work.

## Features Under Consideration

- rtl enhancements
- external file sync option with potential for interfacing with Clippings
- markdown processing including check boxes
