Ever wanted to save some text for later use, or throw some info over from one of your computers to another? This extension 'snips' text from pages you visit (or you can create them manually) and saves them in your browser. Sync them or keep them local, it's up to you. Fully backup compatible with the Clippings extension for Firefox.
