Ever wanted to save some text for later use, or throw some info over from one of your computers to another? This extension 'snips' text from pages you visit (or you can create them manually) and saves them in your browser. Sync them or keep them local, it's up to you. Use the pop-out button for easier organization of your snippets!

This extension aims to become fully backup compatible with the Clippings extension for Firefox. The 0.10 release is a major overhaul from the previous release to be more secure, accessible and robust, as well as to support placeholders.

Roadmap:

1.0 -> Add full counter support, implement shortcut keys

1.1 -> Support for multiple "spaces" to better organize snippets when doing different types of work.

1.2 -> Add external file sync option
